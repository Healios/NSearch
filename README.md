# NSearch
NSearch is a utility for scanning Navision Object files (.FOB & .AL) and finding the objects that contain one or more defined search terms.

The tool is of great help when one is introduced to an existing system, because it is possible to quickly get an overview of said system.

It is also of help when e.g. removing functionality, as one can be sure of getting into every corner of a system by using the right search terms. 

NSearch is currently maintained by Marcus Brown.
